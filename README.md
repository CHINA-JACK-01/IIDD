# Dataset Description
We introduce a Malleable Cast Iron Pipe Fitting Defects Dataset for defect detection in actual ASI scenarios, we refer to this dataset as IIDD. We collect 4020 defect images where each image size is between 360 x 480 and 1536 x 2048 pixels, and contains at least one category defect. There are 9 defect categories and 6313 defect instances in IIDD, each of which is annotated with a bounding box and class label.

# Approach
This section with the source code will be public after the acceptance of the paper.

# Notification

This work is contributed by the paper “The Defect Detection and Classification of Malleable Cast Iron Pipe Fittings to
Promote the Intelligent Manufacturing of Medium or Small Factory”. You can only use this dataset for research purpose.
